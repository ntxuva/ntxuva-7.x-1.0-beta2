## Initial configuration

1. Start with changing the field settings of the field_geo field by choosing a starting position.
http://yourserver/admin/structure/types/manage/report/fields
2. Copy and paste the lat/lon values into the settings of the Mark-a-Spot configuration screen
http://yourserver/admin/config/system/mark_a_spot
3. Make sure that clean urls are supported and active: http://yourserver/?q=admin/config/search/clean-urls

In case you want to run the system with Cloudmade OSM, you may choose the Cloudmade Geolocation Widget and switch to Cloudmade's map tiles in the Mark-a-Spot configuration screen. You will need an Cloudmade API Key for that.
