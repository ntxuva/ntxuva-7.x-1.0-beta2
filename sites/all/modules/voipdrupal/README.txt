VoIP Drupal is an innovative framework that enables users to contribute and access Drupal content via regular touchtone phones, SMS and a variety of Internet-based communication systems (VoIP) such as Skype, IM, or Twitter.

In technical terms, the goal of VoIP Drupal is to provide a common API and scripting system that interoperate with popular Internet-telephony servers (Asterisk, FreeSwitch, Tropo, Twilio, Plivo, etc) dramatically reducing the learning and development costs associated with the construction of communication systems that combine voice and text technologies together.

== To install VoIP Drupal ==

1. Download the VoIP Drupal core modules from http://drupal.org/project/voipdrupal/

2. Enable the desired sub-modules based on the VoIP servers you are planning to use
