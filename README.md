ntxuva
====================
A Participatory Monitoring System for cities in Developing Countries based on Drupal, Mark-a-Spot and VoIP Drupal.

We've themed [Mark-a-Spot](https://www.markaspot.de/) and customized its Open311 API for integration with our tools. Thank you [Holger](https://github.com/markaspot) for all your help & support.

The full history of commits was lost, due to a wrong initial commit. But attribution to Holger's work in maintained in all files.

Ntxuva is the core system that supports [MOPA](http://www.mopa.co.mz/), a participatory monitoring system for waste management currently implemented in Maputo, Mozambique.
